## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
- A method is a way to collapse multiple lines of code into one command. This is helpful when you need to use this code multiple times.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
- def hello
  - puts "Sam I am"
- end

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
- def hello_someone(name)
  - puts "#{name} I am."
- end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
- hello_someone("Lain")
- you could also use $stdin.gets.chomp to prompt the user for their name

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
- I ebb and flow with methods - I can understand them when I read them and follow instructions to create them, I still get a little stuck on syntax when creating my own methods.
